  <h1>Bank Management System</h1>
  <p>A C++ console banking application developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The project simulates a basic banking system with client and user management features.</p>
</div>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>üè¶ Client Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Browse and search through client list</li>
  <li>Add new clients with account details</li>
  <li>Update existing client information</li>
  <li>Delete client accounts when needed</li>
  <li>Find clients using different search criteria</li>
</ul>

<h3>üí∞ Banking Operations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Transfer money between accounts</li>
  <li>Keep track of all transactions</li>
  <li>Check account balances</li>
  <li>Currency exchange with manual rates</li>
</ul>

<h3>üë• Users & Access</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Login/Register system for bank employees</li>
  <li>Basic password encryption for security</li>
  <li>User management and permissions</li>
  <li>Different access levels for employees</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<h3>üîß Written in C++ with OOP principles like:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Classes and objects</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Encapsulation</li>
  <li>File handling for data storage (.txt files)</li>
  <li>Input validation and error handling</li>
  <li>Smart permission management using bitwise operations</li>
</ul>

<p>The system stores all data (clients, users, transactions) in text files, making it a great practice project for file handling in C++. While it's a console application, I focused on making the interface as user-friendly as possible with clear menus and navigation.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>I built this project while following the <a href="https://programmingadvices.com">Programming Advices</a> course (11-OOP) by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud. I'm thrilled to share that I've completed this course, which provided me with structured guidance while allowing me to implement everything myself. The course helped me deeply understand OOP principles through hands-on practice. The permission system using bitwise operations was particularly interesting to implement, and working with file operations in C++ has been a great learning experience.</p>
